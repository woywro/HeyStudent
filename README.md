## Project Overview :fire:

HeyStudent is an app designed to help students find their dream learning path. It allows to find, observe and compare fields of studies. It also helps to meet recruitment deadlines, 
chat with other students and many more! The project is not finished yet, there are still many bugs that I'll try to solve in the nearest future.

## Problems :question:

The biggest problem during coding this app was how to solve the problem of querying firebase. Since firebase doesn't support anything like 'array-contains-all' or multiple querying at once, there were only few options to sort it out. The option I choose was to keep all possible search combinations in tags array in each document. It's not the most elegant solution but until our app grows bigger it will be workng great.
