## Problems :confused:

The biggest problem I faced with during coding this app was the problem of querying firebase. Since it doesn't support anything like array-contains-all or anything similar to sql like, there were only few options to sort it out. At first I'd choosen to keep all possible search combinations as array but it was hard to maintain. Eventually all tags are kept as objects where each tag has a boolean value set to true. This allows to use multiple where clauses which are equal to searched words count.
