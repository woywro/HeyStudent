## Problems :confused:

The biggest problem during coding this app was how to solve the problem of querying firebase. Since firebase doesn't support anything like 'array-contains-all' or multiple querying at once, there were only few options to sort it out. The option I choose was to keep all possible search combinations in tags array in each document. It's not the most elegant solution but until our app grows bigger it will be workng great.
